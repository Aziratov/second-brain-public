# Project: Automated Investing

**Status**: Research Phase
**Priority**: Long-term goal
**Timeline**: TBD — needs foundational research first

## Vision

Build an AI-powered system where Jarvis can:
- Analyze market data and trends
- Execute investment strategies
- Manage a portfolio autonomously
- Report performance and decisions to Mo

## Why This Matters

Mo wants to eventually have a "well-versed employee" (Jarvis) managing investments. This is a complex project that touches:
- Financial APIs and data sources
- Trading algorithms and strategies
- Risk management
- Regulatory compliance
- Portfolio optimization

## Research Areas

### 1. Market Data Sources
- Free APIs: Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage
- Premium APIs: Polygon.io, IEX Cloud
- Real-time vs. delayed data

### 2. Trading Platforms
- Alpaca (commission-free API trading)
- Interactive Brokers (professional-grade)
- Robinhood API (limited)
- TD Ameritrade/Schwab API

### 3. Strategy Types
- Dollar-cost averaging (simple, low-risk start)
- Mean reversion
- Momentum-based
- Sentiment analysis (news + social media)
- Factor-based investing

### 4. Regulatory Considerations
- Paper trading first (simulated)
- SEC regulations on algorithmic trading
- Tax implications of automated trades
- Risk limits and circuit breakers

## Recommended Path

1. **Phase 1**: Research and paper trading — Build a system that monitors and recommends but doesn't execute
2. **Phase 2**: Small-scale automation — DCA into index funds with strict limits
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced strategies — Only after Phase 1-2 prove reliable

## Notes

- Mo explicitly said this is a "really big project" — we should take it slow
- Start with education and research before building anything
- Paper trading is essential before real money
- Need to understand Mo's risk tolerance and investment goals
